# PROFIT

Precision Route Optimization using Fuzzy Inferencing Technology (PROFIT) is a research effort that I began in 2012 and have been working with on and off since then. It uses fuzzy logic cascaded with genetic algorithms to improve the performance of path planning algorithms in applications with uncertain or broad targets. 

Abstract
There are a growing number of applications demonstrating the effectiveness of emulating human decision making using fuzzy logic. Main research challenges include situational awareness and decision making in an uncertain spatio-temporal environment. In this effort, a MATLAB simulation of a surveillance environment was created that placed targets in random areas on a map, with each target having a circular area imposed around it. In the simulation, a fuzzy robot was to find the shortest path around the environment, where it touched each target area at least once (meaning the areas can be passed through) before returning to its starting position. Through fuzzy optimization of a path produced through a genetic algorithm, this task was completed and it was shown that a shorter path could be found through the fuzzy optimization.

The code for PROFIT is being cleaned, organized, and will be uploaded shortly!

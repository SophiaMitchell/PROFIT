# PROFIT

<b>Precision Route Optimization using Fuzzy Inferencing Technology (PROFIT)</b> is a research effort that I began in 2012 and have been working with on and off since then. It uses fuzzy logic cascaded with genetic algorithms to improve the performance of path planning algorithms in applications with uncertain or broad targets. Currently, a comparison of this algorithm with a similar genetic fuzzy algorithm is in the late referee stage of publication to the Journal of Aerospace Information Systems (JAIS).

<h2>Abstract</h2>

There are a growing number of applications demonstrating the effectiveness of emulating human decision making using fuzzy logic. Main research challenges include situational awareness and decision making in an uncertain spatio-temporal environment. In this effort, a MATLAB simulation of a surveillance environment was created that placed targets in random areas on a map, with each target having a circular area imposed around it. In the simulation, a fuzzy robot was to find the shortest path around the environment, where it touched each target area at least once (meaning the areas can be passed through) before returning to its starting position. Results suggest that the path produced by a genetic algorithm through the center of unceratin target areas could be greatly improved with the application of cascading fuzzy logic.
